## Features

- **Modern and Dynamic Design**:  
  - Sleek interface with gradient buttons and hover/press effects.  
  - Animated number display for results (digit-by-digit counter effect).  

- **Mathematical Operations**:  
  - Basic arithmetic: addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, percentage.  
  - Advanced operations: powers, square roots, factorials, exponentials.  
  - Trigonometric functions: `sin`, `cos`, `tan`, `asin`, `acos`, `atan`.  
  - Hyperbolic functions: `sinh`, `cosh`, `tanh`.  
  - Logarithmic functions: `log` (base 10), `ln` (natural log).  

- **User-Friendly Options**:  
  - Degrees or radians mode for trigonometric calculations.  
  - Clear (`C`) and backspace (`←`) buttons for easy input correction.  
  - Dynamic real-time computation with smooth animated results.  

- **Language**:  
  - English interface (all buttons and labels).
